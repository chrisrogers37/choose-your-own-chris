    bio: "Hey, I'm Chris. Welcome to my digital resume and portfolio.\n\nMy work revolves around analytics, automation, and infrastructure—solving complex data problems and turning raw information into meaningful insights. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, whether it's optimizing workflows, building intuitive web tools, or exploring the intersection of data and creativity.\n\nOutside of work, music is another space where I experiment and build. I produce my own tracks, dive into audio engineering, and occasionally DJ in NYC. I like finding ways to blend technology and creativity, whether that's creating a cool new tool or shaping a soundscape.\n\nFeel free to explore my experience, projects, and other interests below. And while you're here, stay a while. Maybe even hit the Summon New Lore button and check out what happens =)",
